## What I learntüìê

- The goal is to create a game with basic Vue JS features to manipulate the DOM.

## Game Logic

On the home screen there is a button to start a new game.

After starting the game, four buttons appear: attack, special attack, heal and give up.

When attacking, the player deals between 3 to 10 points of damage to the monster and receives between 5 and 12 points of damage.

In the special attack, the player deals between 10 and 20 points on the monster and gets between 5 and 12 points of damage.

By healing the player recovers 10 points or until completing 100 and receives between 5 and 12 points of damage of the monster.

Quitting makes the game return to the home screen.

The bars increase and decrease dynamically during the game representing the scores of the player and the monster.

When the player or monster has 0 or fewer points the game ends.

A message of victory or defeat appears and the player can start a new game or not.

If you choose to start a new game, the log is deleted and the game and monstr have 100 points again.
